Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: May 3, 2024, 10:00 PM (UTC)
End Time: May 4, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC)

Impact:
The outage affected 30% of our users, causing slow response times and intermittent service disruptions on our web application.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured load balancer, which failed to distribute incoming traffic evenly across the backend servers, leading to overloading and service degradation.

Timeline:

10:15 PM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
10:20 PM: Engineering team notified of the issue.
10:30 PM: Investigation begins, focusing on backend server performance and network traffic analysis.
11:00 PM: Initial assumption made that the issue might be due to database overload.
11:30 PM: Database performance optimizations attempted but no improvement observed.
12:00 AM: Issue escalated to senior infrastructure team for further assistance.
1:00 AM: Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the likely root cause.
1:30 AM: Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic.
2:00 AM: Service fully restored and confirmed stable.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation:
The misconfigured load balancer was configured to favor certain backend servers over others, causing an uneven distribution of traffic. This resulted in overloaded servers and degraded performance for users.

Resolution:
The load balancer configuration was adjusted to distribute traffic evenly across all backend servers. Additionally, monitoring alerts were fine-tuned to detect similar issues more efficiently in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Regular load balancer configuration audits to ensure proper distribution of traffic.
Enhanced monitoring for load balancer performance and backend server health.
Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations to catch misconfigurations before deployment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations and document best practices.
Update incident response procedures to include load balancer misconfiguration as a potential root cause.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams on load balancer management and troubleshooting techniques.
Implement automated load testing to simulate traffic spikes and verify load balancer performance under different scenarios.
Establish clear communication channels for incident escalation and resolution, ensuring all stakeholders are informed promptly.
By addressing the root cause of the outage and implementing corrective measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable service for our users.
